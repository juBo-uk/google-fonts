google-fonts
============

google-fonts plugin for Elgg 1.8.6+ and Elgg 1.9

This plugin makes it easy to use Google Fonts for a Elgg website.

Notes:

~> The header font only has options for one weight and one style, because that is all that is needed.

~> I might make it possible to choose line-height size in future releases.
